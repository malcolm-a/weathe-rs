# weathe-rs

## About

### Purpose

This is a pretty straightforward Rust project that displays current weather information about the city you enter.

### Demo

By default, you will see the weather for the city your IP address is located in. Here is how it looks:

![](captures/paris.png)

But you can also search for the city you want with the search bar at the top:

The `<Reset>` button resets to your default location.

The `<Quit>` button quits the app.
